# DU_Cybersecurity

A collection of work from the DU Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

The Ansible playbooks can be used to configure dockers on cloud machines.

Bash scripts can be used to set up the system.

The final product involves 5 virtual machines, one running the Ansible container, one running the ELK stack, and three webservers running DVWA.
